### React Kanban

[Live example!](https://react-motion-kanban-gfyinuzipl.now.sh)  
(the example might need to wake up, which will take ~10-15 seconds)

This is an example of a react-motion POC Kanban implementation I wrote for an internal project.
The code is relatively easy to look at, and the `<List />` component can just take more/less arrays as properties.
