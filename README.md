### React Motion Kanban

[Live example!](https://react-motion-kanban-gfyinuzipl.now.sh)

This is an example of a react-motion POC Kanban implementation I wrote for an internal project.
The code is relatively easy to look at, and the `<List />` component can just take more/less arrays as properties.
